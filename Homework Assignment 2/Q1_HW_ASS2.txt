* DB software browser for SQLite is used for running SQL queries
* First create one table named ProjectRoomReservation.
* In create query one constraint is whether start time is less than the end time of slot booking. 
* Create trigger reservationcheker which will check the validity of booking.
* For validating time in trigger as soon as it strikes new insert query it checks for the condition of time before inserting the record in table. 
* The condition is the previous end time should be greater than start time in the new insert query.
* If the condition is met the new record will be inserted and slot booking will be successful. 
* If the condition fails it will automatically raise an error 'Already reserved slot'.
