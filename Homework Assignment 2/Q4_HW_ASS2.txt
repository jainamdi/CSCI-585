* DB software browser for SQLite is used for running SQL queries
* First create one table named STEM_SPAM.
* Insert values into the table using insert command.
* Then it joins STEM_STAMP table with STEM_SPAM and finds the list of ids for all those who are having SameFam null and also checks whether the ID of person
From 1st table in join is same as SameFam from later table.
* Then chooses all the different id satisfying the above condition whether family member has taken STEM course from there or not.
* Then deletes the chosen records from the table STEM_SPAM.

    Name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, 
    Address VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, 
    ID INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    SameFam INTEGER

INSERT INTO STEM_SPAM  VALUES('Ella', 'B', 3, 15);
INSERT INTO STEM_SPAM  VALUES('Farkhad', 'D', 11, NULL);
